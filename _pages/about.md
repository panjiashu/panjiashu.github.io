<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
Hi I'm Jia-Shu Pan (潘嘉书), currently a research intern at University of Chinese Academy of Science ([UCAS](https://english.ucas.ac.cn/)), advised by A/Prof. [Yang Huang](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~yanghuang) and A/Prof. [Yuan-Sen Ting](https://www.mso.anu.edu.au/~yting/). Here is my [CV](/assets/pdf/jspan_resume.pdf).

Previously, I obtained my bachelor degree in astronomy from [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/en/) supervised by A/Prof. [Ruo-Yu Liu](https://astronomy.nju.edu.cn/EN/People/AssociateProfessors/20210209/i188028.html) in 2023. I was a visiting student at Australian National University ([ANU](https://www.anu.edu.au/)) advised by A/Prof. [Yuan-Sen Ting](https://www.mso.anu.edu.au/~yting/) till Feb 2024. My research is centered on **representation learning** of stellar light curves, the temporal brightness variation of stars, with a specific focus on **unsupervised learning** algorithms on irregular and noisy time series.
