    abstract = "{Stellar light curves contain valuable information about oscillations and granulation, offering insights into stars’ internal structures and evolutionary states. Traditional asteroseismic techniques, primarily focused on power spectral analysis, often overlook the crucial phase information in these light curves. Addressing this gap, recent machine learning applications, particularly those using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have made strides in inferring stellar properties from light curves. However, CNNs are limited by their localized feature extraction capabilities. In response, we introduce Astroconformer, a Transformer-based deep learning framework, specifically designed to capture long-range dependencies in stellar light curves. Our empirical analysis centres on estimating surface gravity (log g), using a data set derived from single-quarter Kepler light curves with log g values ranging from 0.2 to 4.4. Astroconformer demonstrates superior performance, achieving a root-mean-square-error (RMSE) of 0.017 dex at log g ≈ 3 in data-rich regimes and up to 0.1 dex in sparser areas. This performance surpasses both K-nearest neighbour models and advanced CNNs. Ablation studies highlight the influence of receptive field size on model effectiveness, with larger fields correlating to improved results. Astroconformer also excels in extracting νmax with high precision. It achieves less than 2 per cent relative median absolute error for 90-d red giant light curves. Notably, the error remains under 3 per cent for 30-d light curves, whose oscillations are undetectable by a conventional pipeline in 30 per cent cases. Furthermore, the attention mechanisms in Astroconformer align closely with the characteristics of stellar oscillations and granulation observed in light curves.}",

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
